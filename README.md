## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive retail sales analysis dashboard built using **Power BI**, based on a synthetic dataset simulating a dynamic retail environment. It analyzes transactional data alongside customer demographics to uncover meaningful trends in purchasing behavior, sales performance, and product category preferences.

The dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights for data analysts, business stakeholders, and decision-makers in retail, aiming to understand how different factors such as age, gender, and product type affect sales outcomes.

## Goal
To develop an interactive and insightful business intelligence dashboard that reveals key patterns in customer behavior, seasonal trends, and product performance, thereby enabling data-driven decisions in a retail context.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on retail transaction data.
- Segment customers by age and gender to explore demographic patterns.
- Analyze sales trends across time (e.g., months, seasons).
- Understand product category performance and price distribution.
- Visualize key metrics with dynamic and filterable visuals.
- Generate actionable insights from data patterns.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI** – for dashboard creation and data visualization
- **Power Query** – for data transformation and cleaning
- **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and KPIs

 ## KPIs
1. **Total Revenue** – Overall income from all transactions.
2. **Transaction Count** – Count of unique purchases.
3. **Average Transaction Value (ATV)** – Mean amount spent per transaction.
4. **Product Category** – Count of product categories
